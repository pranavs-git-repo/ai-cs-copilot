### Writing my observations and thoughts from week-1

With the help of OpenAI documentation it was actually pretty easy to understand how to obtain the API key for the project.

Challenges:
  Setting Environment Variable for Python on the PC. Had to make sure the python installation directory path was correctly referenced in Windows environment variables.
  Had to learn which python libraries to import to get the API Key directly from the .env file.
  Learn how to setup GitHub and manage project with Git.
